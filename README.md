====================
The purpose of this is to help me (and others) manage their misc yahoo teams.   
My first goal is to help out with leagues such as hockey, baseball, and basketball where linups change daily.
I want to be able to swap out playing bench players with non-playing players listed as active.

This requires rauth which can be found here: https://github.com/litl/rauth
